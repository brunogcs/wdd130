        <p>
            Professional with over 8 years of experience in both national and multinational corporations, I am
            passionate
            about
            transforming complex data challenges into clear, actionable insights. My core expertise lies in Data
            Engineering, Data
            Modeling, and ETL processes, where I consistently strive to simplify the complex and optimize pipelines and
            queries for
            maximum efficiency and performance.

            I focus on creating a data-driven culture and ensuring strong data governance. I have a successful history
            of
            leading
            impactful projects. My strategic vision and business insight help me promote data-driven decision-making
            that
            delivers
            real business results.

            Currently pursuing a second degree in Software Development at BYU Idaho, I am continually enhancing my
            technical
            skills
            and knowledge in software engineering principles, always seeking to build robust and scalable data
            solutions. My
            passion
            extends to exploring cutting-edge technologies that streamline data operations and unlock new possibilities
            for
            innovation.
